A tool that analyzes the contents of a .NET assembly file, estimates the file size in bytes used by each type, and shows the results as a tree, grouped by namespace.

Based on  `sizer-net`, a WinForms tool which targets .NET Framework 4.5: https://github.com/schellingb/sizer-net.

For a version of `sizer-net` that targets .NET 8, see my fork: https://github.com/lucaspimentel/sizer-net.
